# **Brazilian app-project-3** 
### This is the third project I did during the Ironhack bootcamp
---

#### We needed to create a Full-Stack Web Application using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, React and Node.JS). Here I have the backend part.
---
#### I created an app for Brazilians living in Berlin, or anyone interested in Brazilian culture.
#### Users can find or advertise Brazilian places, products and services. All liked and created items can be found in the profile page. There is also a chat feature to get in touch with others. This way you can ease homesickness or become more involved in the brazilian culture.
